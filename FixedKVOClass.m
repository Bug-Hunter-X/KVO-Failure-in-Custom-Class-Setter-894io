The solution involves correctly implementing the `willChangeValueForKey:` and `didChangeValueForKey:` methods within the setter of the observed property.  These methods inform the KVO system about the impending change and the completion of the change, respectively.

Here's the corrected code:

```objectivec
@implementation FixedKVOClass

- (void)setValue:(NSString *)newValue forKey:(NSString *)key {
    [self willChangeValueForKey:key]; // Notify KVO before the change
    [super setValue:newValue forKey:key];
    [self didChangeValueForKey:key]; // Notify KVO after the change
}

@end
```
By adding these methods, KVO will function correctly, and observers will be properly notified of changes to the observed property.
