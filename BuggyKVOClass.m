This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) with a custom class that doesn't properly implement the required methods.  Specifically, if you observe a property and the setter method for that property doesn't call `[self willChangeValueForKey:]` and `[self didChangeValueForKey:]`, KVO won't work correctly. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including the observer not being notified of changes.
